# DotFun Project

Welcome to DotFun, an innovative game project, our goal is to provide users with an interesting and challenging gaming environment
## How to Play

Click (or tap) on the ball and drag it around! Use the motion of the ball and tether to destroy each of the enemies, the Drifter, the Eye, and the scariest of all... the Twitchy.

Keep an eye on enemies spawning in, they will charge at you blazing fast after spawning in!

Don't let your tether go wack! If you move it around too much, it becomes uncontrollable and you have an awful time dealing with Eyes.

Instead of charging a Twitchy head on, wait for it to run out of fuel and then destroy it.
